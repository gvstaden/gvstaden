Hi, my name is Gerhard, and I love blockchain technology, programming, smart contracts and everything crypto as I fell in love with it many moons ago.

I have done courses in blockchain development with FreeCodeCamp, DAPP University and EatTheBlocks and do some coding daily and learn new technologies to stay up to date. I have completed some full-stack-developer courses with FreeCodeCamp, but my interest are more in blockchain development.

I would love to do blockchain development full-time as I currently have very limited time as I am currently employed in the health sector and work crazy hours. Sometimes I start at 8 in the morning and only get home at 12 at night, just to start again the next morning. I don't mind the hours as I am a workaholic, but I would love it more if I could devote this time to blockchain development.

Time for a career change :)
