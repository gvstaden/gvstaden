Hi, my name is Gerhard, and I am not a complete noobie to programming as I have done a few courses and worked with writing some programs ages ago when common sense was still common and people were able to think for themselves LOL.

I am interested in everything crypto and blockchain related as for some reason I fell in love with it.

Currently I am doing some courses in blockchain development and has done some courses with FreeCodeCamp, DAPP University and EatTheBlocks. I have created my own coin and love to learn more about blockchain development as I have a few ideas that I would love to see the light when I have enough knowledge. I have completed some full-stack-developer courses with FreeCodeCamp, but my interest are more in blockchain development.

I would love to do blockchain development full-time as I currently have very limited time as I am currently employed in the health sector and work crazy hours. Sometimes I start at 8 in the morning and only get home at 12 at night, just to start again the next morning. I don't mind the hours as I am a workaholic, but I would love it more if I could devote this time to blockchain development.
